        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
            <br /> alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
            <br />All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10]
            <br /> It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
            <br /> functional, and imperative programming styles.
            <br />It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
            <br /> regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
            <br />In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            <br />JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
            <br />The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
            <br />Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

            History - Creation at Netscape
        </h1>
        <p>
            The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993.
            <br />Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[11]
            <br />The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator,
            <br />in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[12][13] During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,
            <br />lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser.
            <br />There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995,
            <br />Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator.
            <br />They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language,
            <br />while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less
            <br />like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.
            <br />[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995,
            <br />the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][14]
        </p>
        <p>
            The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java.
            <br />At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[15]

        <h1>Adoption by Microsoft</h1>
        <p>
            <br />Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front,
            <br />Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[16]
            <br />JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML.
            <br />Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[17][18]
            <br />These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers,
            <br />leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.[17][19]
        </p>
        <p>
            In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to.
            This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.
            The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[16]
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s,
            Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[20]
            This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.
            Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language,
            but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.
